<div>The offical rules of US checkers are derived from World Checkers Draughts Federation
    rules, found at http://www.usacheckers.com/downloads/WCDF_Revised_Rules.doc
</div>

<h3>Order</h3>
<div>The first move in each game is made by the player with the Red disks. The subsequent moves are made in turns.</div>

<h3>Moves</h3>
<div>There are 4 types of moves: ordinary move of a normal piece, ordinary move of a king, the capturing move a a normal
    piece, and the capture of a king.
</div>

<h3>Ordinary move of a normal piece</h3>
<div>A normal piece moves diagonally left or right from one square to an immediately neighboring vacant square</div>
<div>When it reaches the farthest row forward or the opposite side of the board ("king-row" or "crown-head") it becomes
    a king.
</div>

<h3>Ordinary move of a king</h3>
<div>A king can move from one square diagonally forward or backward, left or right, to an immediately neighboring vacant
    square.
</div>

<h3>Capture of a normal piece</h3>
<div>A piece of the opposite color jumps over the piece and lands on the vacant square immediately beyond it. ("jump")
</div>

<h3>General Capturing</h3>
<div>If a jump creates an immediate further captureing opportunity, then the current player can complete that jump until
    all jumps are completed. The only exception is if the piece becomes a king then they may not make any further jumps
</div>
<div>A play must complete all jumps that can be carried out until there are no more jumps available.</div>

<h3>Capture of a king</h3>
<div>Similar to that of a normal piece but can be made in any direction, forwards or backwards.</div>

<h3>Illegal moves</h3>
<div>No illegal moves will be allowed to be made in the game.</div>
